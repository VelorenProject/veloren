# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We are currently in active development, so we only support the latest version of Veloren. Please make sure you are running the latest version before reporting a security vulnerability.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The Veloren team and community take all security vulnerabilities in Veloren seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security vulnerability, please send an email to **security@veloren.net**.

You should include the following information in your report:

*   A description of the vulnerability and its impact.
*   Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
*   Your name and a link to your website or social media profile, if you would like to be credited for your discovery.

We will respond to your report within 48 hours, and will work with you to understand and resolve the issue. We will not disclose any information about the vulnerability until a fix is in place and we have coordinated with you on the release.

## Security Best Practices for Server Admins

If you are running a Veloren server, we recommend the following security best practices:

*   Keep your server up to date with the latest version of Veloren.
*   Do not disable authentication on your server.
*   Use a strong password for your admin account.
*   Do not share your admin account with anyone.
*   Regularly review the `admins.ron` file on your server to ensure that only authorized users have admin privileges.

Thank you for helping to keep Veloren secure.
